# Four Factors Model

In this file, you will see the script written in Python for the Logistic Regression model. This model consists of the Dean Oliver Four Factors, which are Effective Field Goal Percentage (EFG%), Turnover Percentage (TOV%), Rebounding (OREB% & DREB%), and Free Throws (FT/FGA). Using these factors on the offensive and defensive side of the ball, the model of choice here was Logistic Regression. This was the best model of choice as we were predicting a binary outcome, which was winning or losing the game.

Average accuracy and significant variables were vital to the analysis of this model which is represented as visualizations. From this model, we were able to devise a formula to rank the teams from 0-10. If a team got the score of 10, that means that they played perfectly and if they had a score of 0, they played the worst game possible. Go through the paper for more details.

Also in this repository, we have what the sample ranking data will look like. Just note that the paper and the CSVs here don't match due to an error that occured during that time period. Just to be clear, the CSVs in the GitHub are correct while screenshots in paper are wrong.

Expect to make changes to this code file in future years. This model is a start as the goal was to first test how the model would behave given the constraint of working with an extremely small dataset. Find different ways to incorporate more data as this can improve what has been started here. Go through the paper for more details on what occurred throughout the modeling process.
